        Sustainable Development Goal Number 4: Quality Education
        This program was made to simulate a student's life in the form of an entertaining card game!
        You play as an avatar defined in Avatar.java
        Actions are in the form of a card defined in Actions.java
        Subjects/Enemies are in the form of books, 1 book per day for 4 days
        turn number is represented by time, that's 24 hours! but only 7 to 15 are used as per game rules

        OOP Concepts:
        Abstraction: Use of abstract classes and methods such as the abstract class "Actions" and abstract method "getMessage"
        Polymorphism and Inheritance: use of the super method for classes that extend the class "Actions" to do actions different from other inheriting classes
        Encapsulation: Use of setters and getters for values in the classes "Avatar" and "Subjects"
